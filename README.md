# What is this?

This repository contains my solutions to (some of) the Python coding exercises
at [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/python/exercises).

I found the following exercises particularly interesting:

|Exercise                              | Remarks |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
|Rna Transcription                     | Made me learn about `str.translate`. With this is is a straight forward exercise. My first solution used a Python dictionary to make the replacements char by char, joining the results using `str.join`. |  
|ISBN Verifier                         | Part of the task was to find a good way to parse and validate the passed string first. (Some solutions used regular expressions for this. I tried to use only Python.) |
|Bob                                   | Is more or less about finding the order for the various conditionals in the `if-elif` statement that matches the test cases correctly. |
